## Sprint 2: RetrieWordle

### How to run our game:
1. Open an IDE (we used Visual Studio Code) and travel to the directory that contains our code files

2. Run the app.py file first. Upon success, you should now be locally hosting our game at 127.0.0.1:5000 (or wherever you tend to host it, look at the output messages just to make sure). You should see a message like this:

3. Then, within a browser, go to 127.0.0.1:5000/ in order to be brought to our game.

4. The implementation for storing the username has yet to be added, so just click off the initial screen in order to be brought to the game board.

6. Then, either using your actual keyboard or the UI keyboard, try your hand at guessing the secret 5-letter word! As of now, you only have 6 attempts.

(Important Info:) As of now, the winning-game logic and the coloration of the keyboard to indicate whether the letters within your guess are wrong/within the word/correct is yet to be implemented. This will be fully functional by the end of Sprint 3).
