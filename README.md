### How to run our game:
1. Open an IDE (we used Visual Studio Code) and travel to the directory that contains our code files.
---

2. Run the app.py file first. Upon success, you should now be locally hosting our game at `127.0.0.1:5000/` (or wherever you tend to host it, look at the output messages just to make sure). You should see a message like this:

---

3. Then, within a browser, put `127.0.0.1:5000/` as your URL in order to be brought to our game.

<em>You'll be brought to a screen where you enter your username, which will be saved to our database.<br>The amount of puzzles you solved will also be tracked and associated with your username!</em>

* ðŸ”´ Hard: 4 Attempts
* ðŸ”˜ Impossible: 3 Attempts
